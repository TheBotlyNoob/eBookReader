<h2>The New World of Digital Commons</h2>
<p><i>Paul Stacey</i></p>

<div><br/></div>
<div class="noindent">Jonathan Rowe eloquently describes the commons as “the air and oceans, the web of species, wilderness and flowing water—all are parts of the commons. So are language and knowledge, sidewalks and public squares, the stories of childhood and the processes of democracy. Some parts of the commons are gifts of nature, others the product of human endeavor. Some are new, such as the Internet; others are as ancient as soil and calligraphy.”<sup><a href="#ref_1" id="cite_1">1</a></sup></div>
<div>In <b>Made with Creative Commons</b>, we focus on our current era of digital commons, a commons of human-produced works. This commons cuts across a broad range of areas including cultural heritage, education, research, technology, art, design, literature, entertainment, business, and data. Human-produced works in all these areas are increasingly digital. The Internet is a kind of global, digital commons. The individuals, organizations, and businesses we profile in our case studies use Creative Commons to share their resources online over the Internet.</div>
<div>The commons is not just about shared resources, however. It’s also about the social practices and values that manage them. A resource is a noun, but to common—to put the resource into the commons—is a verb.<sup><a href="#ref_2" id="cite_2">2</a></sup> The creators, organizations, and businesses we profile are all engaged with commoning. Their use of Creative Commons involves them in the social practice of commoning, managing resources in a collective manner with a community of users.<sup><a href="#ref_3" id="cite_3">3</a></sup> Commoning is guided by a set of values and norms that balance the costs and benefits of the enterprise with those of the community. Special regard is given to equitable access, use, and sustainability.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_1">The Commons, the Market, and the State</h3>
<div class="noindent">Historically, there have been three ways to manage resources and share wealth: the commons (managed collectively), the state (i.e., the government), and the market—with the last two being the dominant forms today.<sup><a href="#ref_4" id="cite_4">4</a></sup></div>
<div>The organizations and businesses in our case studies are unique in the way they participate in the commons while still engaging with the market and/or state. The extent of engagement with market or state varies. Some operate primarily as a commons with minimal or no reliance on the market or state.<sup><a href="#ref_5" id="cite_5">5</a></sup> Others are very much a part of the market or state, depending on them for financial sustainability. All operate as hybrids, blending the norms of the commons with those of the market or state.&#160;</div>
<div>Fig. 1. is a depiction of how an enterprise can have varying levels of engagement with commons, state, and market.&#160;</div>
<img class='wide' alt="Enterprise" src="../Images/Enterprise.png"/><br/>
<div>Some of our case studies are simply commons and market enterprises with little or no engagement with the state. A depiction of those case studies would show the state sphere as tiny or even absent. Other case studies are primarily market-based with only a small engagement with the commons. A depiction of those case studies would show the market sphere as large and the commons sphere as small. The extent to which an enterprise sees itself as being primarily of one type or another affects the balance of norms by which they operate.</div>
<div>All our case studies generate money as a means of livelihood and sustainability. Money is primarily of the market. Finding ways to generate revenue while holding true to the core values of the commons (usually expressed in mission statements) is challenging. To manage interaction and engagement between the commons and the market requires a deft touch, a strong sense of values, and the ability to blend the best of both.</div>
<div>The state has an important role to play in fostering the use and adoption of the commons. State programs and funding can deliberately contribute to and build the commons. Beyond money, laws and regulations regarding property, copyright, business, and finance can all be designed to foster the commons.</div>
<div>It’s helpful to understand how the commons, market, and state manage resources differently, and not just for those who consider themselves primarily as a commons. For businesses or governmental organizations who want to engage in and use the commons, knowing how the commons operates will help them understand how best to do so. Participating in and using the commons the same way you do the market or state is not a strategy for success.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_2">The Four Aspects of a Resource</h3>
<div class="noindent">As part of her Nobel Prize–winning work, Elinor Ostrom developed a framework for analyzing how natural resources are managed in a commons.<sup><a href="#ref_6" id="cite_6">6</a></sup> Her framework considered things like the biophysical characteristics of common resources, the community’s actors and the interactions that take place between them, rules-in-use, and outcomes. That framework has been simplified and generalized to apply to the commons, the market, and the state for this chapter.</div>
<div>To compare and contrast the ways in which the commons, market, and state work, let’s consider four aspects of resource management: resource characteristics, the people involved and the process they use, the norms and rules they develop to govern use, and finally actual resource use along with outcomes of that use (see Fig. 2).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<img class='wide' alt="Resource_(detailed)" src="../Images/Resource__detailed_.png"/><br/>

<div><br/></div>
<h4 id="sigil_toc_id_3">Characteristics</h4>
<div class="noindent">Resources have particular characteristics or attributes that affect the way they can be used. Some resources are natural; others are human produced. And—significantly for today’s commons—resources can be physical or digital, which affects a resource’s inherent potential.</div>
<div>Physical resources exist in limited supply. If I have a physical resource and give it to you, I no longer have it. When a resource is removed and used, the supply becomes scarce or depleted. Scarcity can result in competing rivalry for the resource. <b>Made with Creative Commons</b> enterprises are usually digitally based but some of our case studies also produce resources in physical form. The costs of producing and distributing a physical good usually require them to engage with the market.</div>
<div>Physical resources are depletable, exclusive, and rivalrous. Digital resources, on the other hand, are nondepletable, nonexclusive, and nonrivalrous. If I share a digital resource with you, we both have the resource. Giving it to you does not mean I no longer have it. Digital resources can be infinitely stored, copied, and distributed without becoming depleted, and at close to zero cost. Abundance rather than scarcity is an inherent characteristic of digital resources.</div>
<div>The nondepletable, nonexclusive, and nonrivalrous nature of digital resources means the rules and norms for managing them can (and ought to) be different from how physical resources are managed. However, this is not always the case. Digital resources are frequently made artificially scarce. Placing digital resources in the commons makes them free and abundant.</div>
<div>Our case studies frequently manage hybrid resources, which start out as digital with the possibility of being made into a physical resource. The digital file of a book can be printed on paper and made into a physical book. A computer-rendered design for furniture can be physically manufactured in wood. This conversion from digital to physical invariably has costs. Often the digital resources are managed in a free and open way, but money is charged to convert a digital resource into a physical one.</div>
<div>Beyond this idea of physical versus digital, the commons, market, and state conceive of resources differently (see Fig. 3). The market sees resources as private goods—commodities for sale—from which value is extracted. The state sees resources as public goods that provide value to state citizens. The commons sees resources as common goods, providing a common wealth extending beyond state boundaries, to be passed on in undiminished or enhanced form to future generations.</div>
<img class='wide' alt="Goods" src="../Images/Goods.png"/><br/>
<div><br/></div>
<h4 id="sigil_toc_id_4">People and processes</h4>
<div class="noindent">In the commons, the market, and the state, different people and processes are used to manage resources. The processes used define both who has a say and how a resource is managed.&#160;</div>
<div>In the state, a government of elected officials is responsible for managing resources on behalf of the public. The citizens who produce and use those resources are not directly involved; instead, that responsibility is given over to the government. State ministries and departments staffed with public servants set budgets, implement programs, and manage resources based on government priorities and procedures.</div>
<div>In the market, the people involved are producers, buyers, sellers, and consumers. Businesses act as intermediaries between those who produce resources and those who consume or use them. Market processes seek to extract as much monetary value from resources as possible. In the market, resources are managed as commodities, frequently mass-produced, and sold to consumers on the basis of a cash transaction.</div>
<div>In contrast to the state and market, resources in a commons are managed more directly by the people involved.<sup><a href="#ref_7" id="cite_7">7</a></sup> Creators of human produced resources can put them in the commons by personal choice. No permission from state or market is required. Anyone can participate in the commons and determine for themselves the extent to which they want to be involved—as a contributor, user, or manager. The people involved include not only those who create and use resources but those affected by outcome of use. Who you are affects your say, actions you can take, and extent of decision making. In the commons, the community as a whole manages the resources. Resources put into the commons using Creative Commons require users to give the original creator credit. Knowing the person behind a resource makes the commons less anonymous and more personal.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<h4 id="sigil_toc_id_5">Norms and rules</h4>
<div class="noindent">The social interactions between people, and the processes used by the state, market, and commons, evolve social norms and rules. These norms and rules define permissions, allocate entitlements, and resolve disputes.</div>
<div>State authority is governed by national constitutions. Norms related to priorities and decision making are defined by elected officials and parliamentary procedures. State rules are expressed through policies, regulations, and laws. The state influences the norms and rules of the market and commons through the rules it passes.</div>
<div>Market norms are influenced by economics and competition for scarce resources. Market rules follow property, business, and financial laws defined by the state.&#160;</div>
<div>As with the market, a commons can be influenced by state policies, regulations, and laws. But the norms and rules of a commons are largely defined by the community. They weigh individual costs and benefits against the costs and benefits to the whole community. Consideration is given not just to economic efficiency but also to equity and sustainability.<sup><a href="#ref_9" id="cite_9">9</a></sup></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<h4 id="sigil_toc_id_6">Goals</h4>
<div class="noindent">The combination of the aspects we’ve discussed so far—the resource’s inherent characteristics, people and processes, and norms and rules—shape how resources are used. Use is also influenced by the different goals the state, market, and commons have.</div>
<div>In the market, the focus is on maximizing the utility of a resource. What we pay for the goods we consume is seen as an objective measure of the utility they provide. The goal then becomes maximizing total monetary value in the economy.<sup><a href="#ref_10" id="cite_10">10</a></sup> Units consumed translates to sales, revenue, profit, and growth, and these are all ways to measure goals of the market.</div>
<div>The state aims to use and manage resources in a way that balances the economy with the social and cultural needs of its citizens. Health care, education, jobs, the environment, transportation, security, heritage, and justice are all facets of a healthy society, and the state applies its resources toward these aims. State goals are reflected in quality of life measures.&#160;</div>
<div>In the commons, the goal is maximizing access, equity, distribution, participation, innovation, and sustainability. You can measure success by looking at how many people access and use a resource; how users are distributed across gender, income, and location; if a community to extend and enhance the resources is being formed; and if the resources are being used in innovative ways for personal and social good.</div>
<div>As hybrid combinations of the commons with the market or state, the success and sustainability of all our case study enterprises depends on their ability to strategically utilize and balance these different aspects of managing resources.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_7">A Short History of the Commons</h3>
<div class="noindent">Using the commons to manage resources is part of a long historical continuum. However, in contemporary society, the market and the state dominate the discourse on how resources are best managed. Rarely is the commons even considered as an option. The commons has largely disappeared from consciousness and consideration. There are no news reports or speeches about the commons.</div>
<div>But the more than 1.1 billion resources licensed with Creative Commons around the world are indications of a grassroots move toward the commons. The commons is making a resurgence. To understand the resilience of the commons and its current renewal, it’s helpful to know something of its history.</div>
<div>For centuries, indigenous people and preindustrialized societies managed resources, including water, food, firewood, irrigation, fish, wild game, and many other things collectively as a commons.<sup><a href="#ref_11" id="cite_11">11</a></sup> There was no market, no global economy. The state in the form of rulers influenced the commons but by no means controlled it. Direct social participation in a commons was the primary way in which resources were managed and needs met. (Fig. 4 illustrates the commons in relation to the state and the market.)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<img class='wide' alt="Pre-industrialised" src="../Images/Pre-industrialised.png"/><br/>
<div><br/></div>
<div>This is followed by a long history of the state (a monarchy or ruler) taking over the commons for their own purposes. This is called enclosure of the commons.<sup><a href="#ref_12" id="cite_12">12</a></sup> In olden days, “commoners” were evicted from the land, fences and hedges erected, laws passed, and security set up to forbid access.<sup><a href="#ref_13" id="cite_13">13</a></sup> Gradually, resources became the property of the state and the state became the primary means by which resources were managed. (See Fig. 5).</div>
<div><img class='wide' alt="State_takeover" src="../Images/State_takeover.png"/><br/></div>
<div>Holdings of land, water, and game were distributed to ruling family and political appointees. Commoners displaced from the land migrated to cities. With the emergence of the industrial revolution, land and resources became commodities sold to businesses to support production. Monarchies evolved into elected parliaments. Commoners became labourers earning money operating the machinery of industry. Financial, business, and property laws were revised by governments to support markets, growth, and productivity. Over time ready access to market produced goods resulted in a rising standard of living, improved health, and education. Fig. 6 shows how today the market is the primary means by which resources are managed.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<img class='wide' alt="Today" src="../Images/Today.png"/><br/>
<div><br/></div>
<div>However, the world today is going through turbulent times. The benefits of the market have been offset by unequal distribution and overexploitation.</div>
<div>Overexploitation was the topic of Garrett Hardin’s influential essay “The Tragedy of the Commons,” published in Science in 1968. Hardin argues that everyone in a commons seeks to maximize personal gain and will continue to do so even when the limits of the commons are reached. The commons is then tragically depleted to the point where it can no longer support anyone. Hardin’s essay became widely accepted as an economic truism and a justification for private property and free markets.</div>
<div>However, there is one serious flaw with Hardin’s “The Tragedy of the Commons”—it’s fiction. Hardin did not actually study how real commons work. Elinor Ostrom won the 2009 Nobel Prize in economics for her work studying different commons all around the world. Ostrom’s work shows that natural resource commons can be successfully managed by local communities without any regulation by central authorities or without privatization. Government and privatization are not the only two choices. There is a third way: management by the people, where those that are directly impacted are directly involved. With natural resources, there is a regional locality. The people in the region are the most familiar with the natural resource, have the most direct relationship and history with it, and are therefore best situated to manage it. Ostrom’s approach to the governance of natural resources broke with convention; she recognized the importance of the commons as an alternative to the market or state for solving problems of collective action.<sup><a href="#ref_14" id="cite_14">14</a></sup></div>
<div>Hardin failed to consider the actual social dynamic of the commons. His model assumed that people in the commons act autonomously, out of pure self-interest, without interaction or consideration of others. But as Ostrom found, in reality, managing common resources together forms a community and encourages discourse. This naturally generates norms and rules that help people work collectively and ensure a sustainable commons. Paradoxically, while Hardin’s essay is called The Tragedy of the Commons it might more accurately be titled The Tragedy of the Market.</div>
<div>Hardin’s story is based on the premise of depletable resources. Economists have focused almost exclusively on scarcity-based markets. Very little is known about how abundance works.<sup><a href="#ref_15" id="cite_15">15</a></sup> The emergence of information technology and the Internet has led to an explosion in digital resources and new means of sharing and distribution. Digital resources can never be depleted. An absence of a theory or model for how abundance works, however, has led the market to make digital resources artificially scarce and makes it possible for the usual market norms and rules to be applied.</div>
<div>When it comes to use of state funds to create digital goods, however, there is really no justification for artificial scarcity. The norm for state funded digital works should be that they are freely and openly available to the public that paid for them.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_8">The Digital Revolution</h3>
<div class="noindent">In the early days of computing, programmers and developers learned from each other by sharing software. In the 1980s, the free-software movement codified this practice of sharing into a set of principles and freedoms:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><ul><li><span style="text-indent: 25px;">The freedom to run a software program as you wish, for any purpose.</span><br/></li>
<li><span style="text-indent: 25px;">The freedom to study how a software program works (because access to the source code has been freely given), and change it so it does your computing as you wish.</span><br/></li>
<li><span style="text-indent: 25px;">The freedom to redistribute copies.</span><br/></li>
<li><span style="text-indent: 25px;">The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others.</span><sup style="text-indent: 25px;"><a href="#ref_16" id="cite_16">16</a></sup><br/></li>
</ul>
</div>



<div><br/></div>
<div>These principles and freedoms constitute a set of norms and rules that typify a digital commons.</div>
<div>In the late 1990s, to make the sharing of source code and collaboration more appealing to companies, the open-source-software initiative converted these principles into licenses and standards for managing access to and distribution of software. The benefits of open source—such as reliability, scalability, and quality verified by independent peer review—became widely recognized and accepted. Customers liked the way open source gave them control without being locked into a closed, proprietary technology. Free and open-source software also generated a network effect where the value of a product or service increases with the number of people using it.<sup><a href="#ref_17" id="cite_17">17</a></sup> The dramatic growth of the Internet itself owes much to the fact that nobody has a proprietary lock on core Internet protocols.</div>
<div>While open-source software functions as a commons, many businesses and markets did build up around it. Business models based on the licenses and standards of open-source software evolved alongside organizations that managed software code on principles of abundance rather than scarcity. Eric Raymond’s essay “The Magic Cauldron” does a great job of analyzing the economics and business models associated with open-source software.<sup><a href="#ref_18" id="cite_18">18</a></sup> These models can provide examples of sustainable approaches for those <b>Made with Creative Commons</b>.</div>
<div>It isn’t just about an abundant availability of digital assets but also about abundance of participation. The growth of personal computing, information technology, and the Internet made it possible for mass participation in producing creative works and distributing them. Photos, books, music, and many other forms of digital content could now be readily created and distributed by almost anyone. Despite this potential for abundance, by default these digital works are governed by copyright laws. Under copyright, a digital work is the property of the creator, and by law others are excluded from accessing and using it without the creator’s permission.</div>
<div>But people like to share. One of the ways we define ourselves is by sharing valuable and entertaining content. Doing so grows and nourishes relationships, seeks to change opinions, encourages action, and informs others about who we are and what we care about. Sharing lets us feel more involved with the world.<sup><a href="#ref_19" id="cite_19">19</a></sup></div>
<div><br/></div>
<h3 class="noindent" id="sigil_toc_id_9">The Birth of Creative Commons</h3>
<div>In 2001, Creative Commons was created as a nonprofit to support all those who wanted to share digital content. A suite of Creative Commons licenses was modeled on those of open-source software but for use with digital content rather than software code. The licenses give everyone from individual creators to large companies and institutions a simple, standardized way to grant copyright permissions to their creative work.</div>
<div>Creative Commons licenses have a three-layer design. The norms and rules of each license are first expressed in full legal language as used by lawyers. This layer is called the legal code. But since most creators and users are not lawyers, the licenses also have a commons deed, expressing the permissions in plain language, which regular people can read and quickly understand. It acts as a user-friendly interface to the legal-code layer beneath. The third layer is the machine-readable one, making it easy for the Web to know a work is Creative Commons–licensed by expressing permissions in a way that software systems, search engines, and other kinds of technology can understand.<sup><a href="#ref_20" id="cite_20">20</a></sup> Taken together, these three layers ensure creators, users, and even the Web itself understand the norms and rules associated with digital content in a commons.</div>
<div>In 2015, there were over one billion Creative Commons licensed works in a global commons. These works were viewed online 136 billion times. People are using Creative Commons licenses all around the world, in thirty-four languages. These resources include photos, artwork, research articles in journals, educational resources, music and other audio tracks, and videos.</div>
<div>Individual artists, photographers, musicians, and filmmakers use Creative Commons, but so do museums, governments, creative industries, manufacturers, and publishers. Millions of websites use CC licenses, including major platforms like Wikipedia and Flickr and smaller ones like blogs.<sup><a href="#ref_21" id="cite_21">21</a></sup> Users of Creative Commons are diverse and cut across many different sectors. (Our case studies were chosen to reflect that diversity.)</div>
<div>Some see Creative Commons as a way to share a gift with others, a way of getting known, or a way to provide social benefit. Others are simply committed to the norms associated with a commons. And for some, participation has been spurred by the free-culture movement, a social movement that promotes the freedom to distribute and modify creative works. The free-culture movement sees a commons as providing significant benefits compared to restrictive copyright laws. This ethos of free exchange in a commons aligns the free-culture movement with the free and open-source software movement.</div>
<div>Over time, Creative Commons has spawned a range of open movements, including open educational resources, open access, open science, and open data. The goal in every case has been to democratize participation and share digital resources at no cost, with legal permissions for anyone to freely access, use, and modify.</div>
<div>The state is increasingly involved in supporting open movements. The Open Government Partnership was launched in 2011 to provide an international platform for governments to become more open, accountable, and responsive to citizens. Since then, it has grown from eight participating countries to seventy.<sup><a href="#ref_22" id="cite_22">22</a></sup> In all these countries, government and civil society are working together to develop and implement ambitious open-government reforms. Governments are increasingly adopting Creative Commons to ensure works funded with taxpayer dollars are open and free to the public that paid for them.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<h3 class="noindent" id="sigil_toc_id_10">The Changing Market&#160;</h3>
<div>Today’s market is largely driven by global capitalism. Law and financial systems are structured to support extraction, privatization, and corporate growth. A perception that the market is more efficient than the state has led to continual privatization of many public natural resources, utilities, services, and infrastructures.<sup><a href="#ref_23" id="cite_23">23</a></sup> While this system has been highly efficient at generating consumerism and the growth of gross domestic product, the impact on human well-being has been mixed. Offsetting rising living standards and improvements to health and education are ever-increasing wealth inequality, social inequality, poverty, deterioration of our natural environment, and breakdowns of democracy.<sup><a href="#ref_24" id="cite_24">24</a></sup></div>
<div>In light of these challenges there is a growing recognition that GDP growth should not be an end in itself, that development needs to be socially and economically inclusive, that environmental sustainability is a requirement not an option, and that we need to better balance the market, state and community.<sup><a href="#ref_25" id="cite_25">25</a></sup></div>
<div>These realizations have led to a resurgence of interest in the commons as a means of enabling that balance. City governments like Bologna, Italy, are collaborating with their citizens to put in place regulations for the care and regeneration of urban commons.<sup><a href="#ref_26" id="cite_26">26</a></sup> Seoul and Amsterdam call themselves “sharing cities,” looking to make sustainable and more efficient use of scarce resources. They see sharing as a way to improve the use of public spaces, mobility, social cohesion, and safety.<sup><a href="#ref_27" id="cite_27">27</a></sup></div>
<div>The market itself has taken an interest in the sharing economy, with businesses like Airbnb providing a peer-to-peer marketplace for short-term lodging and Uber providing a platform for ride sharing. However, Airbnb and Uber are still largely operating under the usual norms and rules of the market, making them less like a commons and more like a traditional business seeking financial gain. Much of the sharing economy is not about the commons or building an alternative to a corporate-driven market economy; it’s about extending the deregulated free market into new areas of our lives.<sup><a href="#ref_28" id="cite_28">28</a></sup> While none of the people we interviewed for our case studies would describe themselves as part of the sharing economy, there are in fact some significant parallels. Both the sharing economy and the commons make better use of asset capacity. The sharing economy sees personal residents and cars as having latent spare capacity with rental value. The equitable access of the commons broadens and diversifies the number of people who can use and derive value from an asset.&#160;</div>
<div>One way <b>Made with Creative Commons</b> case studies differ from those of the sharing economy is their focus on digital resources. Digital resources function under different economic rules than physical ones. In a world where prices always seem to go up, information technology is an anomaly. Computer-processing power, storage, and bandwidth are all rapidly increasing, but rather than costs going up, costs are coming down. Digital technologies are getting faster, better, and cheaper. The cost of anything built on these technologies will always go down until it is close to zero.<sup><a href="#ref_29" id="cite_29">29</a></sup></div>
<div>Those that are <b>Made with Creative Commons</b> are looking to leverage the unique inherent characteristics of digital resources, including lowering costs. The use of digital-rights-management technologies in the form of locks, passwords, and controls to prevent digital goods from being accessed, changed, replicated, and distributed is minimal or nonexistent. Instead, Creative Commons licenses are used to put digital content out in the commons, taking advantage of the unique economics associated with being digital. The aim is to see digital resources used as widely and by as many people as possible. Maximizing access and participation is a common goal. They aim for abundance over scarcity.</div>
<div>The incremental cost of storing, copying, and distributing digital goods is next to zero, making abundance possible. But imagining a market based on abundance rather than scarcity is so alien to the way we conceive of economic theory and practice that we struggle to do so.<sup><a href="#ref_30" id="cite_30">30</a></sup> Those that are <b>Made with Creative Commons</b> are each pioneering in this new landscape, devising their own economic models and practice.</div>
<div>Some are looking to minimize their interactions with the market and operate as autonomously as possible. Others are operating largely as a business within the existing rules and norms of the market. And still others are looking to change the norms and rules by which the market operates.</div>
<div>For an ordinary corporation, making social benefit a part of its operations is difficult, as it’s legally required to make decisions that financially benefit stockholders. But new forms of business are emerging. There are benefit corporations and social enterprises, which broaden their business goals from making a profit to making a positive impact on society, workers, the community, and the environment.<sup><a href="#ref_31" id="cite_31">31</a></sup> Community-owned businesses, worker-owned businesses, cooperatives, guilds, and other organizational forms offer alternatives to the traditional corporation. Collectively, these alternative market entities are changing the rules and norms of the market.<sup><a href="#ref_32" id="cite_32">32</a></sup>&#160;</div>
<div>“A book on open business models” is how we described it in this book’s Kickstarter campaign. We used a handbook called Business Model Generation as our reference for defining just what a business model is. Developed over nine years using an “open process” involving 470 coauthors from forty-five countries, it is useful as a framework for talking about business models.<sup><a href="#ref_33" id="cite_33">33</a></sup>&#160;</div>
<div>It contains a “business model canvas,” which conceives of a business model as having nine building blocks.<sup><a href="#ref_34" id="cite_34">34</a></sup> This blank canvas can serve as a tool for anyone to design their own business model. We remixed this business model canvas into an open business model canvas, adding three more building blocks relevant to hybrid market, commons enterprises: social good, Creative Commons license, and “type of open environment that the business fits in.”<sup><a href="#ref_35" id="cite_35">35</a></sup> This enhanced canvas proved useful when we analyzed businesses and helped start-ups plan their economic model.</div>
<div>In our case study interviews, many expressed discomfort over describing themselves as an open business model—the term business model suggested primarily being situated in the market. Where you sit on the commons-to-market spectrum affects the extent to which you see yourself as a business in the market. The more central to the mission shared resources and commons values are, the less comfort there is in describing yourself, or depicting what you do, as a business. Not all who have endeavors <b>Made with Creative Commons</b> use business speak; for some the process has been experimental, emergent, and organic rather than carefully planned using a predefined model.</div>
<div>The creators, businesses, and organizations we profile all engage with the market to generate revenue in some way. The ways in which this is done vary widely. Donations, pay what you can, memberships, “digital for free but physical for a fee,” crowdfunding, matchmaking, value-add services, patrons . . . the list goes on and on. (Initial description of how to earn revenue available through reference note. For latest thinking see How to Bring In Money in the next section.)<sup><a href="#ref_36" id="cite_36">36</a></sup> There is no single magic bullet, and each endeavor has devised ways that work for them. Most make use of more than one way. Diversifying revenue streams lowers risk and provides multiple paths to sustainability.</div>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_11">Benefits of the Digital Commons</h3>
<div class="noindent">While it may be clear why commons-based organizations want to interact and engage with the market (they need money to survive), it may be less obvious why the market would engage with the commons. The digital commons offers many benefits.</div>
<div><i>The commons speeds dissemination. </i>The free flow of resources in the commons offers tremendous economies of scale. Distribution is decentralized, with all those in the commons empowered to share the resources they have access to. Those that are <b>Made with Creative Commons</b> have a reduced need for sales or marketing. Decentralized distribution amplifies supply and know-how.</div>
<div><i>The commons ensures access to all.</i> The market has traditionally operated by putting resources behind a paywall requiring payment first before access. The commons puts resources in the open, providing access up front without payment. Those that are <b>Made with Creative Commons</b> make little or no use of digital rights management (DRM) to manage resources. Not using DRM frees them of the costs of acquiring DRM technology and staff resources to engage in the punitive practices associated with restricting access. The way the commons provides access to everyone levels the playing field and promotes inclusiveness, equity, and fairness.</div>
<div><i>The commons maximizes participation.</i> Resources in the commons can be used and contributed to by everyone. Using the resources of others, contributing your own, and mixing yours with others to create new works are all dynamic forms of participation made possible by the commons. Being <b>Made with Creative Commons</b> means you’re engaging as many users with your resources as possible. Users are also authoring, editing, remixing, curating, localizing, translating, and distributing. The commons makes it possible for people to directly participate in culture, knowledge building, and even democracy, and many other socially beneficial practices.</div>
<div><i>The commons spurs innovation.</i> Resources in the hands of more people who can use them leads to new ideas. The way commons resources can be modified, customized, and improved results in derivative works never imagined by the original creator. Some endeavors that are <b>Made with Creative Commons</b> deliberately encourage users to take the resources being shared and innovate them. Doing so moves research and development (R&amp;D) from being solely inside the organization to being in the community.<sup><a href="#ref_37" id="cite_37">37</a></sup> Community-based innovation will keep an organization or business on its toes. It must continue to contribute new ideas, absorb and build on top of the innovations of others, and steward the resources and the relationship with the community.</div>
<div><i>The commons boosts reach and impact.</i> The digital commons is global. Resources may be created for a local or regional need, but they go far and wide generating a global impact. In the digital world, there are no borders between countries. When you are <b>Made with Creative Commons</b>, you are often local and global at the same time: Digital designs being globally distributed but made and manufactured locally. Digital books or music being globally distributed but readings and concerts performed locally. The digital commons magnifies impact by connecting creators to those who use and build on their work both locally and globally.</div>
<div><i>The commons is generative.</i> Instead of extracting value, the commons adds value. Digitized resources persist without becoming depleted, and through use are improved, personalized, and localized. Each use adds value. The market focuses on generating value for the business and the customer. The commons generates value for a broader range of beneficiaries including the business, the customer, the creator, the public, and the commons itself. The generative nature of the commons means that it is more cost-effective and produces a greater return on investment. Value is not just measured in financial terms. Each new resource added to the commons provides value to the public and contributes to the overall value of the commons.</div>
<div><i>The commons brings people together for a common cause.</i> The commons vests people directly with the responsibility to manage the resources for the common good. The costs and benefits for the individual are balanced with the costs and benefits for the community and for future generations. Resources are not anonymous or mass produced. Their provenance is known and acknowledged through attribution and other means. Those that are <b>Made with Creative Commons</b> generate awareness and reputation based on their contributions to the commons. The reach, impact, and sustainability of those contributions rest largely on their ability to forge relationships and connections with those who use and improve them. By functioning on the basis of social engagement, not monetary exchange, the commons unifies people.</div>
<div>The benefits of the commons are many. When these benefits align with the goals of individuals, communities, businesses in the market, or state enterprises, choosing to manage resources as a commons ought to be the option of choice.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_12">Our Case Studies</h3>
<div class="noindent">The creators, organizations, and businesses in our case studies operate as nonprofits, for-profits, and social enterprises. Regardless of legal status, they all have a social mission. Their primary reason for being is to make the world a better place, not to profit. Money is a means to a social end, not the end itself. They factor public interest into decisions, behavior, and practices. Transparency and trust are really important. Impact and success are measured against social aims expressed in mission statements, and are not just about the financial bottom line.</div>
<div>The case studies are based on the narratives told to us by founders and key staff. Instead of solely using financials as the measure of success and sustainability, they emphasized their mission, practices, and means by which they measure success. Metrics of success are a blend of how social goals are being met and how sustainable the enterprise is.</div>
<div>Our case studies are diverse, ranging from publishing to education and manufacturing. All of the organizations, businesses, and creators in the case studies produce digital resources. Those resources exist in many forms including books, designs, songs, research, data, cultural works, education materials, graphic icons, and video. Some are digital representations of physical resources. Others are born digital but can be made into physical resources.&#160;</div>
<div>They are creating new resources, or using the resources of others, or mixing existing resources together to make something new. They, and their audience, all play a direct, participatory role in managing those resources, including their preservation, curation, distribution, and enhancement. Access and participation is open to all regardless of monetary means.&#160;</div>
<div>And as users of Creative Commons licenses, they are automatically part of a global community. The new digital commons is global. Those we profiled come from nearly every continent in the world. To build and interact within this global community is conducive to success.&#160;</div>
<div>Creative Commons licenses may express legal rules around the use of resources in a commons, but success in the commons requires more than following the letter of the law and acquiring financial means. Over and over we heard in our interviews how success and sustainability are tied to a set of beliefs, values, and principles that underlie their actions: Give more than you take. Be open and inclusive. Add value. Make visible what you are using from the commons, what you are adding, and what you are monetizing. Maximize abundance. Give attribution. Express gratitude. Develop trust; don’t exploit. Build relationship and community. Be transparent. Defend the commons.&#160;</div>
<div>The new digital commons is here to stay. <b>Made with Creative Commons</b> case studies show how it’s possible to be part of this commons while still functioning within market and state systems. The commons generates benefits neither the market nor state can achieve on their own. Rather than the market or state dominating as primary means of resource management, a more balanced alternative is possible.</div>
<div>Enterprise use of Creative Commons has only just begun. The case studies in this book are merely starting points. Each is changing and evolving over time. Many more are joining and inventing new models. This overview aims to provide a framework and language for thinking and talking about the new digital commons. The remaining sections go deeper providing further guidance and insights on how it works.</div>
