<div class="noindent">Jonathan Mann thinks of his business model as “hustling”—seizing nearly every opportunity he sees to make money. The bulk of his income comes from writing songs under commission for people and companies, but he has a wide variety of income sources. He has supporters on the crowdfunding site Patreon. He gets advertising revenue from YouTube and Bandcamp, where he posts all of his music. He gives paid speaking engagements about creativity and motivation. He has been hired by major conferences to write songs summarizing what speakers have said in the conference sessions.</div>
<div>His entrepreneurial spirit is coupled with a willingness to take action quickly. A perfect illustration of his ability to act fast happened in 2010, when he read that Apple was having a conference the following day to address a snafu related to the iPhone 4. He decided to write and post a song about the iPhone 4 that day, and the next day he got a call from the public relations people at Apple wanting to use and promote his video at the Apple conference. The song then went viral, and the experience landed him in Time magazine.</div>
<div>Jonathan’s successful “hustling” is also about old-fashioned persistence. He is currently in his eighth straight year of writing one song each day. He holds the Guinness World Record for consecutive daily songwriting, and he is widely known as the “song-a-day guy.”</div>
<div>He fell into this role by, naturally, seizing a random opportunity a friend alerted him to seven years ago—an event called Fun-A-Day, where people are supposed to create a piece of art every day for thirty-one days straight. He was in need of a new project, so he decided to give it a try by writing and posting a song each day. He added a video component to the songs because he knew people were more likely to watch video online than simply listening to audio files.</div>
<div>He had a really good time doing the thirty-one-day challenge, so he decided to see if he could continue it for one year. He never stopped. He has written and posted a new song literally every day, seven days a week, since he began the project in 2009. When he isn’t writing songs that he is hired to write by clients, he writes songs about whatever is on his mind that day. His songs are catchy and mostly lighthearted, but they often contain at least an undercurrent of a deeper theme or meaning. Occasionally, they are extremely personal, like the song he cowrote with his exgirlfriend announcing their breakup. Rain or shine, in sickness or health, Jonathan posts and writes a song every day. If he is on a flight or otherwise incapable of getting Internet access in time to meet the deadline, he will prepare ahead and have someone else post the song for him.</div>
<div>Over time, the song-a-day gig became the basis of his livelihood. In the beginning, he made money one of two ways. The first was by entering a wide variety of contests and winning a handful. The second was by having the occasional song and video go some varying degree of viral, which would bring more eyeballs and mean that there were more people wanting him to write songs for them. Today he earns most of his money this way.</div>
<div>His website explains his gig as “taking any message, from the super simple to the totally complicated, and conveying that message through a heartfelt, fun and quirky song.” He charges $500 to create a produced song and $300 for an acoustic song. He has been hired for product launches, weddings, conferences, and even Kickstarter campaigns like the one that funded the production of this book.</div>

<div class="noindent">Jonathan can’t recall when exactly he first learned about Creative Commons, but he began applying CC licenses to his songs and videos as soon as he discovered the option. “CC seems like such a no-brainer,” Jonathan said. “I don’t understand how anything else would make sense. It seems like such an obvious thing that you would want your work to be able to be shared.”</div>
<div>His songs are essentially marketing for his services, so obviously the further his songs spread, the better. Using CC licenses helps grease the wheels, letting people know that Jonathan allows and encourages them to copy, interact with, and remix his music. “If you let someone cover your song or remix it or use parts of it, that’s how music is supposed to work,” Jonathan said. “That is how music has worked since the beginning of time. Our me-me, mine-mine culture has undermined that.”</div>
<div>There are some people who cover his songs fairly regularly, and he would never shut that down. But he acknowledges there is a lot more he could do to build community. “There is all of this conventional wisdom about how to build an audience online, and I generally think I don’t do any of that,” Jonathan said.</div>
<div>He does have a fan community he cultivates on Bandcamp, but it isn’t his major focus. “I do have a core audience that has stuck around for a really long time, some even longer than I’ve been doing song-a-day,” he said. “There is also a transitional aspect that drop in and get what they need and then move on.” Focusing less on community building than other artists makes sense given Jonathan’s primary income source of writing custom songs for clients.</div>
<div>Jonathan recognizes what comes naturally to him and leverages those skills. Through the practice of daily songwriting, he realized he has a gift for distilling complicated subjects into simple concepts and putting them to music. In his song “How to Choose a Master Password,” Jonathan explained the process of creating a secure password in a silly, simple song. He was hired to write the song by a client who handed him a long technical blog post from which to draw the information. Like a good (and rare) journalist, he translated the technical concepts into something understandable.</div>
<div>When he is hired by a client to write a song, he first asks them to send a list of talking points and other information they want to include in the song. He puts all of that into a text file and starts moving things around, cutting and pasting until the message starts to come together. The first thing he tries to do is grok the core message and develop the chorus. Then he looks for connections or parts he can make rhyme. The entire process really does resemble good journalism, but of course the final product of his work is a song rather than news. “There is something about being challenged and forced to take information that doesn’t seem like it should be sung about&#160;</div>
<div>or doesn’t seem like it lends itself to a song,” he said. “I find that creative challenge really satisfying. I enjoy getting lost in that process.”</div>
<div>Jonathan admits that in an ideal world, he would exclusively write the music he wanted to write, rather than what clients hire him to write. But his business model is about capitalizing on his strengths as a songwriter, and he has found a way to keep it interesting for&#160;</div>
<div>himself.</div>
<div>Jonathan uses nearly every tool possible to make money from his art, but he does have lines he won’t cross. He won’t write songs about things he fundamentally does not believe in, and there are times he has turned down jobs on principle. He also won’t stray too much from his natural style. “My style is silly, so I can’t really accommodate people who want something super serious,” Jonathan said. “I do what I do very easily, and it’s part of who I am.” Jonathan hasn’t gotten into writing commercials for the same reasons; he is best at using his own unique style rather than mimicking others.</div>
<p><br/></p>
<div class="noindent">Jonathan’s song-a-day commitment exemplifies the power of habit and grit. Conventional wisdom about creative productivity, including advice in books like the best-seller The Creative Habit by Twyla Tharp, routinely emphasizes the importance of ritual and action. No amount of planning can replace the value of simple practice and just doing. Jonathan Mann’s work is a living embodiment of these principles.</div>
<div>When he speaks about his work, he talks about how much the song-a-day process has changed him. Rather than seeing any given piece of work as precious and getting stuck on trying to make it perfect, he has become comfortable with just doing. If today’s song is a bust, tomorrow’s song might be better.</div>
<div>Jonathan seems to have this mentality about his career more generally. He is constantly experimenting with ways to make a living while sharing his work as widely as possible, seeing what sticks. While he has major accomplishments he is proud of, like being in the Guinness World Records or having his song used by Steve Jobs, he says he never truly feels successful.</div>
<div>“Success feels like it’s over,” he said. “To a certain extent, a creative person is not ever going to feel completely satisfied because then so much of what drives you would be gone.”</div>
