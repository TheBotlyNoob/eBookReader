<p><i>Profile written by Paul Stacey&#160;</i></p>

<div class="noindent">Andrew Jaspan spent years as an editor of major newspapers including the Observer in London, the Sunday Herald in Glasgow, and the Age in Melbourne, Australia. He experienced firsthand the decline of newspapers, including the collapse of revenues, layoffs, and the constant pressure to reduce costs. After he left the Age in 2005, his concern for the future journalism didn’t go away. Andrew made a commitment to come up with an alternative model.&#160;</div>
<p><br/></p>
<div class="noindent">Around the time he left his job as editor of the Melbourne Age, Andrew wondered where citizens would get news grounded in fact and evidence rather than opinion or ideology. He believed there was still an appetite for journalism with depth and substance but was concerned about the increasing focus on the sensational and sexy.</div>
<div>While at the Age, he’d become friends with a vice-chancellor of a university in Melbourne who encouraged him to talk to smart people across campus—an astrophysicist, a Nobel laureate, earth scientists, economists . . . These were the kind of smart people he wished were more involved in informing the world about what is going on and correcting the errors that appear in media. However, they were reluctant to engage with mass media. Often, journalists didn’t understand what they said, or unilaterally chose what aspect of a story to tell, putting out a version that these people felt was wrong or mischaracterized. Newspapers want to attract a mass audience. Scholars want to communicate serious news, findings, and insights. It’s not a perfect match. Universities are massive repositories of knowledge, research, wisdom, and expertise. But a lot of that stays behind a wall of their own making—there are the walled garden and ivory tower metaphors, and in more literal terms, the paywall. Broadly speaking, universities are part of society but disconnected from it. They are an enormous public resource but not that good at presenting their expertise to the wider public.</div>
<div>Andrew believed he could to help connect academics back into the public arena, and maybe help society find solutions to big problems. He thought about pairing professional editors with university and research experts, working one-on-one to refine everything from story structure to headline, captions, and quotes. The editors could help turn something that is academic into something understandable and readable. And this would be a key difference from traditional journalism—the subject matter expert would get a chance to check the article and give final approval before it is published. Compare this with reporters just picking and choosing the quotes and writing whatever they want.</div>
<div>The people he spoke to liked this idea, and Andrew embarked on raising money and support with the help of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), the University of Melbourne, Monash University, the University of Technology Sydney, and the University of Western Australia. These founding partners saw the value of an independent information channel that would also showcase the talent and knowledge of the university and research sector. With their help, in 2011, the Conversation, was launched as an independent news site in Australia. Everything published in the Conversation is openly licensed with Creative Commons.</div>
<p><br/></p>
<div class="noindent">The Conversation is founded on the belief that underpinning a functioning democracy is access to independent, high-quality, informative journalism. The Conversation’s aim is for people to have a better understanding of current affairs and complex issues—and hopefully a better quality of public discourse. The Conversation sees itself as a source of trusted information dedicated to the public good. Their core mission is simple: to provide readers with a reliable source of evidence-based information.</div>
<div>Andrew worked hard to reinvent a methodology for creating reliable, credible content. He introduced strict new working practices, a charter, and codes of conduct.<sup><a href="#ref_1" id="cite_1">1</a></sup> These include fully disclosing who every author is (with their relevant expertise); who is funding their research; and if there are any potential or real conflicts of interest. Also important is where the content originates, and even though it comes from the university and research community, it still needs to be fully disclosed. The Conversation does not sit behind a paywall. Andrew believes access to information is an issue of equality—everyone should have access, like access to clean water. The Conversation is committed to an open and free Internet. Everyone should have free access to their content, and be able to share it or republish it.&#160;</div>
<div>Creative Commons help with these goals; articles are published with the Attribution-</div>
<div>NoDerivs license (CC BY-ND). They’re freely available for others to republish elsewhere as long as attribution is given and the content is not edited. Over five years, more than twenty-two thousand sites have republished their content. The Conversation website gets about 2.9 million unique views per month, but through republication they have thirty-five million readers. This couldn’t have been done without the Creative Commons license, and in Andrew’s view, Creative Commons is central to everything the Conversation does.</div>
<div>When readers come across the Conversation, they seem to like what they find and recommend it to their friends, peers, and networks. Readership has grown primarily through word of mouth. While they don’t have sales and marketing, they do promote their work through social media (including Twitter and Facebook), and by being an accredited supplier to Google News.</div>
<p><br/></p>
<div class="noindent">It’s usual for the founders of any company to ask themselves what kind of company it should be. It quickly became clear to the founders of the Conversation that they wanted to create a public good rather than make money off of information. Most media companies are working to aggregate as many eyeballs as possible and sell ads. The Conversation founders didn’t want this model. It takes no advertising and is a not-for-profit venture.</div>
<div>There are now different editions of the Conversation for Africa, the United Kingdom, France, and the United States, in addition to the one for Australia. All five editions have their own editorial mastheads, advisory boards, and content. The Conversation’s global virtual newsroom has roughly ninety staff working with thirty-five thousand academics from over sixteen hundred universities around the world. The Conversation would like to be working with university scholars from even more parts of the world.</div>
<div>Additionally, each edition has its own set of founding partners, strategic partners, and funders. They’ve received funding from foundations, corporates, institutions, and individual donations, but the Conversation is shifting toward paid memberships by universities and research institutions to sustain operations. This would safeguard the current service and help improve coverage and features.</div>
<div>When professors from member universities write an article, there is some branding of the university associated with the article. On the Conversation website, paying university members are listed as “members and funders.” Early participants may be designated as “founding members,” with seats on the editorial advisory board.</div>
<div>Academics are not paid for their contributions, but they get free editing from a professional (four to five hours per piece, on average). They also get access to a large audience. Every author and member university has access to a special analytics dashboard where they can check the reach of an article. The metrics include what people are tweeting, the comments, countries the readership represents, where the article is being republished, and the number of readers per article.</div>
<div>The Conversation plans to expand the dashboard to show not just reach but impact. This tracks activities, behaviors, and events that occurred as a result of publication, including things like a scholar being asked to go on a show to discuss their piece, give a talk at a conference, collaborate, submit a journal paper, and consult a company on a topic.&#160;</div>
<div>These reach and impact metrics show the benefits of membership. With the Conversation, universities can engage with the public and show why they’re of value.</div>
<div>With its tagline, “Academic Rigor, Journalistic Flair,” the Conversation represents a new form of journalism that contributes to a more informed citizenry and improved democracy around the world. Its open business model and use of Creative Commons show how it’s possible to generate both a public good and operational revenue at the same time.</div>
