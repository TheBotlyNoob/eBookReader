<div class="noindent">The serial entrepreneur Dr. Frances Pinter has been at the forefront of innovation in the publishing industry for nearly forty years. She founded the UK-based Knowledge Unlatched with a mission to enable open access to scholarly books. For Frances, the current scholarly-</div>
<div>book-publishing system is not working for anyone, and especially not for monographs in the humanities and social sciences. Knowledge Unlatched is committed to changing this and has been working with libraries to create a sustainable alternative model for publishing scholarly books, sharing the cost of making monographs (released under a Creative Commons license) and savings costs over the long term. Since its launch, Knowledge Unlatched has received several awards, including the IFLA/Brill Open Access award in 2014 and a Curtin University Commercial Innovation Award for Innovation in Education in 2015.</div>
<p><br/></p>
<div class="noindent">Dr. Pinter has been in academic publishing most of her career. About ten years ago, she became acquainted with the Creative Commons founder Lawrence Lessig and got interested in Creative Commons as a tool for both protecting content online and distributing it free to users.</div>
<div>Not long after, she ran a project in Africa convincing publishers in Uganda and South Africa to put some of their content online for free using a Creative Commons license and to see what happened to print sales. Sales went up, not down.</div>
<div>In 2008, Bloomsbury Academic, a new imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing in the United Kingdom, appointed her its founding publisher in London. As part of the launch, Frances convinced Bloomsbury to differentiate themselves by putting out monographs for free online under a Creative Commons license (BY-NC or BY-NC-ND, i.e., Attribution-NonCommercial or Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs). This was seen as risky, as the biggest cost for publishers is getting a book to the stage where it can be printed. If everyone read the online book for free, there would be no print-book sales at all, and the costs associated with getting the book to print would be lost. Surprisingly, Bloomsbury found that sales of the print versions of these books were 10 to 20 percent higher than normal. Frances found it intriguing that the Creative Commons–licensed free online book acts as a marketing vehicle for the print format.</div>
<div>Frances began to look at customer interest in the three forms of the book: 1) the Creative Commons–licensed free online book in PDF form, 2) the printed book, and 3) a digital version of the book on an aggregator platform with enhanced features. She thought of this as the “ice cream model”: the free PDF was vanilla ice cream, the printed book was an ice cream cone, and the enhanced e-book was an ice cream sundae.</div>
<div>After a while, Frances had an epiphany—what if there was a way to get libraries to underwrite the costs of making these books up until they’re ready be printed, in other words, cover the fixed costs of getting to the first digital copy? Then you could either bring down the cost of the printed book, or do a whole bunch of interesting things with the printed book and e-book—the ice cream cone or sundae part of the model.</div>
<div>This idea is similar to the article-processing charge some open-access journals charge researchers to cover publishing costs. Frances began to imagine a coalition of libraries paying for the prepress costs—a “book-processing charge”—and providing everyone in the world with an open-access version of the books released under a Creative Commons license.</div>
<div>This idea really took hold in her mind. She didn’t really have a name for it but began talking about it and making presentations to see if there was interest. The more she talked about it, the more people agreed it had appeal. She offered a bottle of champagne to anyone who could come up with a good name for the idea. Her husband came up with Knowledge Unlatched, and after two years of generating interest, she decided to move forward and launch a community interest company (a UK term for not-for-profit social enterprises) in 2012.</div>
<p><br/></p>
<div class="noindent">She describes the business model in a paper called Knowledge Unlatched: Toward an Open and Networked Future for Academic Publishing:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><ol><li><span style="text-indent: 25px;">Publishers offer titles for sale reflecting origination costs only via Knowledge Unlatched.</span><br/></li>
<li><span style="text-indent: 25px;">Individual libraries select titles either as individual titles or as collections (as they do from library suppliers now).</span><br/></li>
<li><span style="text-indent: 25px;">Their selections are sent to Knowledge Unlatched specifying the titles to be purchased at the stated price(s).</span><br/></li>
<li><span style="text-indent: 25px;">The price, called a Title Fee (set by publishers and negotiated by Knowledge Unlatched), is paid to publishers to cover the fixed costs of publishing each of the titles that were selected by a minimum number of libraries to cover the Title Fee.</span><br/></li>
<li><span style="text-indent: 25px;">Publishers make the selected titles available Open Access (on a Creative Commons or similar open license) and are then paid the Title Fee which is the total collected from the libraries.</span><br/></li>
<li><span style="text-indent: 25px;">Publishers make print copies, e-Pub, and other digital versions of selected titles available to member libraries at a discount that reflects their contribution to the Title Fee and incentivizes membership.</span><sup style="text-indent: 25px;"><a href="#ref_1" id="cite_1">1</a></sup><br/></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The first round of this model resulted in a collection of twenty-eight current titles from thirteen recognized scholarly publishers being unlatched. The target was to have two hundred libraries participate. The cost of the package per library was capped at $1,680, which was an average price of sixty dollars per book, but in the end they had nearly three hundred libraries sharing the costs, and the price per book came in at just under forty-three dollars.</div>
<div>The open-access, Creative Commons versions of these twenty-eight books are still available online.<sup><a href="#ref_4" id="cite_4">4</a></sup> Most books have been licensed with CC BY-NC or CC BY-NC-ND. Authors are the copyright holder, not the publisher, and negotiate choice of license as part of the publishing agreement. Frances has found that most authors want to retain control over the commercial and remix use of their work. Publishers list the book in their catalogs, and the noncommercial restriction in the Creative Commons license ensures authors continue to get royalties on sales of physical copies.</div>
<div>There are three cost variables to consider for each round: the overall cost incurred by the publishers, total cost for each library to acquire all the books, and the individual price per book. The fee publishers charge for each title is a fixed charge, and Knowledge Unlatched calculates the total amount for all the books being unlatched at a time. The cost of an order for each library is capped at a maximum based on a minimum number of libraries participating. If the number of participating libraries exceeds the minimum, then the cost of the order and the price per book go down for each library.</div>
<div>The second round, recently completed, unlatched seventy-eight books from twenty-six publishers. For this round, Frances was experimenting with the size and shape of the offerings. Books were being bundled into eight small packages separated by subject (including Anthropology, History, Literature, Media and Communications, and Politics), of around ten books per package. Three hundred libraries around the world have to commit to at least six of the eight packages to enable unlatching. The average cost per book was just under fifty dollars. The unlatching process took roughly ten months. It started with a call to publishers for titles, followed by having a library task force select the titles, getting authors’ permissions, getting the libraries to pledge, billing the libraries, and finally, unlatching.</div>
<p><br/></p>
<div class="noindent">The longest part of the whole process is getting libraries to pledge and commit funds. It takes about five months, as library buy-in has to fit within acquisition cycles, budget cycles, and library-committee meetings.</div>
<div>Knowledge Unlatched informs and recruits libraries through social media, mailing lists, listservs, and library associations. Of the three hundred libraries that participated in the first round, 80 percent are also participating in the second round, and there are an additional eighty new libraries taking part. Knowledge Unlatched is also working not just with individual libraries but also library consortia, which has been getting even more libraries involved.</div>
<div>Knowledge Unlatched is scaling up, offering 150 new titles in the second half of 2016. It will also offer backlist titles, and in 2017 will start to make journals open access too.</div>
<p><br/></p>
<div class="noindent">Knowledge Unlatched deliberately chose monographs as the initial type of book to unlatch. Monographs are foundational and important, but also problematic to keep going in the standard closed publishing model.</div>
<div>The cost for the publisher to get to a first digital copy of a monograph is $5,000 to $50,000. A good one costs in the $10,000 to $15,000 range. Monographs typically don’t sell a lot of copies. A publisher who in the past sold three thousand copies now typically sells only three hundred. That makes unlatching monographs a low risk for publishers. For the first round, it took five months to get thirteen publishers. For the second round, it took one month to get twenty-six.</div>
<div>Authors don’t generally make a lot of royalties from monographs. Royalties range from zero dollars to 5 to 10 percent of receipts. The value to the author is the awareness it brings to them; when their book is being read, it increases their reputation. Open access through unlatching generates many more downloads and therefore awareness. (On the Knowledge Unlatched website, you can find interviews with the twenty-eight round-one authors describing their experience and the benefits of taking part.)<sup><a href="#ref_5" id="cite_5">5</a></sup></div>
<div>Library budgets are constantly being squeezed, partly due to the inflation of journal subscriptions. But even without budget constraints, academic libraries are moving away from buying physical copies. An academic library catalog entry is typically a URL to wherever the book is hosted. Or if they have enough electronic storage space, they may download the digital file into their digital repository. Only secondarily do they consider getting a print book, and if they do, they buy it separately from the digital version.</div>
<div>Knowledge Unlatched offers libraries a compelling economic argument. Many of the participating libraries would have bought a copy of the monograph anyway, but instead of paying $95 for a print copy or $150 for a digital multiple-use copy, they pay $50 to unlatch. It costs them less, and it opens the book to not just the participating libraries, but to the world.</div>
<div>Not only do the economics make sense, but there is very strong alignment with library mandates. The participating libraries pay less than they would have in the closed model, and the open-access book is available to all libraries. While this means nonparticipating libraries could be seen as free riders, in the library world, wealthy libraries are used to paying more than poor libraries and accept that part of their money should be spent to support open access. “Free ride” is more like community responsibility. By the end of March 2016, the round-one books had been downloaded nearly eighty thousand times in 175 countries.</div>
<div>For publishers, authors, and librarians, the Knowledge Unlatched model for monographs is a win-win-win.</div>
<p><br/></p>
<div class="noindent">In the first round, Knowledge Unlatched’s overheads were covered by grants. In the second round, they aim to demonstrate the model is sustainable. Libraries and publishers will each pay a 7.5 percent service charge that will go toward Knowledge Unlatched’s running costs. With plans to scale up in future rounds, Frances figures they can fully recover costs when they are unlatching two hundred books at a time. Moving forward, Knowledge Unlatched is making investments in technology and processes. Future plans include unlatching journals and older books.</div>
<div>Frances believes that Knowledge Unlatched is tapping into new ways of valuing academic content. It’s about considering how many people can find, access, and use your content without pay barriers. Knowledge Unlatched taps into the new possibilities and behaviors of the digital world. In the Knowledge Unlatched model, the content-creation process is exactly the same as it always has been, but the economics are different. For Frances, Knowledge Unlatched is connected to the past but moving into the future, an evolution rather than a revolution.</div>
