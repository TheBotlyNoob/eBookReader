<h2>The Creative Commons Licenses</h2>
<div class="noindent">All of the Creative Commons licenses grant a basic set of permissions. At a minimum, a CC-&#160;<span style="text-indent: 25px;">licensed work can be copied and shared in its original form for noncommercial purposes so long as attribution is given to the creator. There are six licenses in the CC license suite that build on that basic set of permissions, ranging from the most restrictive (allowing only those basic permissions to share unmodified copies for noncommercial purposes) to the most permissive (reusers can do anything they want with the work, even for commercial purposes, as long as they give the creator credit). The licenses are built on copyright and do not cover other types of rights that creators might have in their works, like patents or trademarks.&#160;</span></div>
<div class="noindent">Here are the six licenses:</div>

<p><br/></p>
<div><img alt="by" src="../Images/by.png"/><br/></div>
<div>The Attribution license (CC BY) lets others distribute, remix, tweak, and build upon your work, even commercially, as long as they credit you for the original creation. This is the most accommodating of licenses offered. Recommended for maximum dissemination and use of licensed materials.</div>
<p><br/></p>
<div><img alt="by-sa" src="../Images/by-sa.png"/><br/></div>
<div>The Attribution-Share-Alike license (CC BY-SA) lets others remix, tweak, and build upon your work, even for commercial purposes, as long as they credit you and license their new creations under identical terms. This license is often compared to “copyleft” free and open source software licenses. All new works based on yours will carry the same license, so any derivatives will also allow commercial use.&#160;</div>
<p><br/></p>
<div><img alt="by-nd" src="../Images/by-nd.png"/><br/></div>
<div>The Attribution-NoDerivs license (CC BY-ND) allows for redistribution, commercial and noncommercial, as long as it is passed along unchanged with credit to you.</div>
<p><br/></p>
<div><img alt="by-nc" src="../Images/by-nc.png"/><br/></div>
<div>The Attribution-NonCommercial license (CC BY-NC) lets others remix, tweak, and build upon your work noncommercially. Although their new works must also acknowledge you, they don’t have to license their derivative works on the same terms.</div>
<p><br/></p>
<div><img alt="by-nc-sa" src="../Images/by-nc-sa.png"/><br/></div>
<div>The Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike license (CC BY-NC-SA) lets others remix, tweak, and build upon your work noncommercially, as long as they credit you and license their new creations under the same terms.</div>
<p><br/></p>
<div><img alt="by-nc-nd" src="../Images/by-nc-nd.png"/><br/></div>
<div>The Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs license (CC BY-NC-ND) is the most restrictive of our six main licenses, only allowing others to download your works and share them with others as long as they credit you, but they can’t change them or use them commercially.</div>
<p><br/></p>
<div class="noindent">In addition to these six licenses, Creative Commons has two public-domain tools—one for creators and the other for those who manage collections of existing works by authors whose terms of copyright have expired:</div>
<p><br/></p>

<div><img alt="cc-zero" src="../Images/cc-zero.png"/><br/></div>
<div>CC0 enables authors and copyright owners to dedicate their works to the worldwide public domain (“no rights reserved”).&#160;</div>
<p><br/></p>
<div><img alt="publicdomain" src="../Images/publicdomain.png"/><br/></div>
<div>The Creative Commons Public Domain Mark facilitates the labeling and discovery of works that are already free of known copyright restrictions.</div>
<hr/>
<div class="noindent">In our case studies, some use just one Creative Commons license, others use several. Attribution (found in thirteen case studies) and Attribution-ShareAlike (found in eight studies) were the most common, with the other licenses coming up in four or so case studies, including the public-domain tool CC0. Some of the organizations we profiled offer both digital content and software: by using open-source-software licenses for the software code and Creative Commons licenses for digital content, they amplify their involvement with and commitment to sharing.</div>
<div>There is a popular misconception that the three NonCommercial licenses offered by CC are the only options for those who want to make money off their work. As we hope this book makes clear, there are many ways to make endeavors that are <b>Made with Creative Commons</b> sustainable. Reserving commercial rights is only one of those ways. It is certainly true that a license that allows others to make commercial use of your work (CC BY, CC BY-SA, and CC BY-ND) forecloses some traditional revenue streams. If you apply an Attribution (CC BY) license to your book, you can’t force a film company to pay you royalties if they turn your book into a feature-length film, or prevent another company from selling physical copies of your work.&#160;</div>
<div>The decision to choose a NonCommercial and/or NoDerivs license comes down to how much you need to retain control over the creative work. The NonCommercial and NoDerivs licenses are ways of reserving some significant portion of the exclusive bundle of rights that copyright grants to creators. In some cases, reserving those rights is important to how you bring in revenue. In other cases, creators use a NonCommercial or NoDerivs license because they can’t give up on the dream of hitting the creative jackpot. The music platform Tribe of Noise told us the NonCommercial licenses were popular among their users because people still held out the dream of having a major record label discover their work.&#160;</div>
<div>Other times the decision to use a more restrictive license is due to a concern about the integrity of the work. For example, the nonprofit TeachAIDS uses a NoDerivs license for its educational materials because the medical subject matter is particularly important to get right.&#160;</div>
<div>There is no one right way. The NonCommercial and NoDerivs restrictions reflect the values and preferences of creators about how their creative work should be reused, just as the ShareAlike license reflects a different set of values, one that is less about controlling access to their own work and more about ensuring that whatever gets created with their work is available to all on the same terms. Since the beginning of the commons, people have been setting up structures that helped regulate the way in which shared resources were used. The CC licenses are an attempt to standardize norms across all domains.</div>
