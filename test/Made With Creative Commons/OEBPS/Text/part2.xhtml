<h1>Part 2:</h1>
<h2> The Case Studies</h2>
<div class='noindent'>The twenty-four case studies in this section were chosen from hundreds of nominations received from Kickstarter backers, Creative Commons staff, and the global Creative Commons community. We selected eighty potential candidates that represented a mix of industries, content types, revenue streams, and parts of the world. Twelve of the case studies were selected from that group based on votes cast by Kickstarter backers, and the other twelve were selected by us.&#160;</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>We did background research and conducted interviews for each case study, based on the same set of basic questions about the endeavor. The idea for each case study is to tell the story about the endeavor and the role sharing plays within it, largely the way in which it was told to us by those we interviewed.&#160;</div>
